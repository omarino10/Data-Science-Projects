## Projects Overview  

### Classification Project  
**Dataset Description**  
This project focuses on customer churn prediction. The dataset includes detailed information about:  
- **Churn**: Whether customers left within the last month.  
- **Services**: Subscriptions like phone, internet, online security, device protection, and streaming services.  
- **Customer Account Information**: Contract type, payment method, billing preferences, monthly charges, and total charges.  
- **Demographics**: Gender, age range, partnership status, and dependents.  

Each row in the dataset represents a customer, and columns represent various attributes. The goal is to classify customers likely to churn based on their profiles.

### Clustering Project  
**Dataset Description**  
This project explores clustering in the context of music genres. The dataset consists of approximately 3,000 music genres aggregated from over 170,000 songs collected via Spotify Web API.  
- **Primary Feature**: Genre (music genre label).  
- **Numerical Features**: Attributes like acousticness, danceability, energy, duration, valence, popularity, tempo, loudness, and more.  
- **Categorical Features**: Key (musical scale key) and other identifiers.  

The objective is to group similar music genres based on their features, enabling insights into trends and preferences.

### Linear Regression Project  
**Dataset Description**  
This project involves predicting car auction prices. The dataset contains historical data scraped from various sources in 2015, detailing auctions for used cars.  

**Key Features**:  
- **Year, Make, Model, Trim**: Vehicle details like production year, brand, and configuration.  
- **Body, Transmission**: Vehicle body type and transmission mechanism.  
- **Condition and Odometer**: Car condition (rated 1-5) and mileage.  
- **Color**: Exterior and interior colors.  
- **Seller and State**: Seller details and auction state.  
- **MMR and Selling Price**: Manheim Market Report (estimated wholesale price) and actual auction price.  
- **Sale Date**: Date of the auction.  

The goal is to use regression techniques to predict a carâ€™s selling price based on its attributes.
